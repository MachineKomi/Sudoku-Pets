## Notes for Generation

- All sprites with characters/objects need **transparent backgrounds**
- Use consistent lighting (top-left light source)
- Keep style consistent across all assets
- Test at actual game resolution to ensure readability
- Gems especially need to be visually distinct even at small sizes
