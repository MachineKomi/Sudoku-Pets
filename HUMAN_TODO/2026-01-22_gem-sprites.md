# Simplified sprite modifier:
## To generate new versions of these sprites from the 4K versions that will show up cleanly at the resolution they will actually be displayed at in game: 

You are refining an existing high-resolution (4K) anime gemstone sprite into a
SMALL-UI-OPTIMIZED VERSION.

GOAL
Create a shiny anime gem icon that reads clearly at very small sizes.
Prioritize clarity, bold shapes, and smooth surfaces over fine detail.

STYLE
- Clean anime game UI art style.
- Still shiny and glossy, but NOT hyper-detailed.
- Reduce visual noise so the gem remains readable when downscaled.

SIMPLIFICATION RULES (CRITICAL)
- Remove micro-facets and tiny sparkles.
- Use FEWER, LARGER facets instead of many small ones.
- Thicken all facet edges and silhouette outlines.
- Prefer smooth gradients and broad highlights.
- No thin linework that would disappear at small resolutions.

NUMBER
- Centered number "{1}". 
- Bright pure white (#FFFFFF).
- Slight soft glow only (subtle, controlled).
- No texture, no grain, no bevel noise.
- Thick, clean strokes that remain readable at small size.

LIGHTING
- One main soft highlight.
- One secondary rim highlight.
- Avoid starburst sparkles or tiny specular points.
- Overall softer, calmer lighting.

COLOR
- Saturated but controlled.
- Avoid extreme contrast inside the gem.
- Clear color identity even when reduced to 32px.

BACKGROUND / EXPORT
- TRUE transparent background (alpha).
- No background color, no checkerboard, no gradient.
- No drop shadow.
- No glow outside the gem silhouette.

COMPOSITION
- Centered.
- Generous padding.
- Clean, bold silhouette.

INTENT
This sprite must look GOOD and LEGIBLE when scaled down for UI icons.
Think “Nintendo / JRPG UI gem icon”, not “realistic crystal macro photo”.
